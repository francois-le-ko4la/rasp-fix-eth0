# rasp-fix-eth0

This Bash script configures the network settings of the eth0 interface on a Linux machine. It is designed to work with networkd-dispatcher to automatically apply network settings when the interface reaches the routable state.
This script was created to address an issue where my network card defaulted to 100Mbps during the boot process due to a side effect on my Raspberry Pi 4/Ubuntu server 20.04. My switch does not allow disabling auto-negotiation, and the speed/duplex settings can only be configured when auto-negotiation is turned off.
I did not want to change the network renderer.

## üìã Features

  - Existing Settings Check:
    The script checks if the eth0 interface is already configured with the following parameters:
    - Speed: 1000Mb/s
    - Duplex: Full
  - If the parameters are correct, the script exits without making any changes.
  - Else:
    - Disable Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE): To avoid potential performance issues, EEE is disabled.
    - Network Configuration:
      If necessary, the script sets the following:
          Speed to 1000Mb/s
          Duplex mode to Full
          Auto-negotiation to On
  
    - Logging:
    Actions taken by the script are logged to the system journal using logger for easy monitoring.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This script is not intended to replace existing tools but to fix specific issues with network settings.
Before using this script, ensure that:
- The network card, port, and switch support gigabit speeds.
- You have tested the script in a controlled environment before deploying it in production.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Place the script in a directory such as /opt/scripts/ (or any other desired location):
```ssh
sudo cp configure-eth0.sh /opt/scripts/configure-eth0.sh
sudo chmod +x /opt/scripts/configure-eth0.sh
```

To ensure networkd-dispatcher runs the script, create a symbolic link in /etc/networkd-dispatcher/routable.d/:
```ssh
sudo ln -s /opt/scripts/configure-eth0.sh /etc/networkd-dispatcher/routable.d/10-configure-eth0.sh
```

Verify:
Ensure networkd-dispatcher is active and configured to manage network interfaces:
```ssh
systemctl status networkd-dispatcher
```

## üöÄ Usage

The script runs automatically when the eth0 interface reaches the routable state. It:
- Checks if the network settings are already correct.
- Applies necessary adjustments if required.

Logs for the script execution can be viewed using:
```ssh
journalctl -t configure-eth0
```

## üìù Requirements

Linux with systemd-networkd and networkd-dispatcher installed.
The ethtool utility must be installed:
```ssh
sudo apt install ethtool
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Log Output
